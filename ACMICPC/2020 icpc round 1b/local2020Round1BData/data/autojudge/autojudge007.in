This case also has the maximum amount of output permitted in the spec-
ification, ten lines with 70 characters each. Other cases will be used
to test things like blank lines in this "correct output" section ofthe
input for this autojudge problem. Due to the convergence of forces be-
yond his comprehension, Salvatore Quannucci was suddently squirted out
of the universe like a watermelon seed, never to be heard from again!!
Note that a real autojudge program would have to deal with lots of po-
tentially bad behaviours of a submitted program, including infinite lo
ops which generate unconstrained amounts of output. This program hope-
fully gives some people an idea of how an autojudge might work. Finis.
